<h1>Fast browserify builds with watchify</h1>

<p>As a <a href="http://github.com/substack/node-browserify">browserify</a> project begins to
expand, the time to bundle it slowly gets longer and longer. While it might
start at 1 second, it's possible to be waiting 30 seconds for your project to
build on particularly large projects.</p>

<p>That's why <a href="http://github.com/substack">substack</a> wrote
<a href="http://github.com/substack/watchify">watchify</a>, a persistent browserify
bundler that watches files for changes and <em>only rebuilds what it needs to</em>.
This way, that first build might still take 30 seconds, but subsequent builds
can still run in under 100ms â€“ which is a huge improvement.</p>

<p>Watchify doesn't have a gulp plugin, but it doesn't need one either: you can
use <a href="http://github.com/hughsk/vinyl-source-stream">vinyl-source-stream</a> to pipe
the bundle stream into your gulp pipeline.</p>

<p>``` javascript
var gulp = require('gulp')
var source = require('vinyl-source-stream')
var watchify = require('watchify')</p>

<p>gulp.task('watch', function() {
  var bundler = watchify('./src/index.js');</p>

<p>// Optionally, you can apply transforms
  // and other configuration options on the
  // bundler just as you would with browserify
  bundler.transform('brfs')</p>

<p>bundler.on('update', rebundle)</p>

<p>function rebundle () {
    return bundler.bundle()
      .pipe(source('bundle.js'))
      .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist'))
  }</p>

<p>return rebundle()
})
```</p>
