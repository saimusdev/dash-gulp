<h1>Running tasks in series</h1>

<p>By default, tasks run with maximum concurrency -- e.g. it launches all the tasks at once and waits for nothing.
If you want to create a series where tasks run in a particular order, you need to do two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>give it a hint to tell it when the task is done,</li>
<li>and give it a hint that a task depends on completion of another.</li>
</ul>

<p>For these examples, let's presume you have two tasks, "one" and "two" that you specifically want to run in this order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In task "one" you add a hint to tell it when the task is done.  Either take in a callback and call it when you're
done or return a promise or stream that the engine should wait to resolve or end respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>In task "two" you add a hint telling the engine that it depends on completion of the first task.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So this example would look like this:</p>

<p>```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');</p>

<p>// takes in a callback so the engine knows when it'll be done
gulp.task('one', function(cb) {
    // do stuff -- async or otherwise
    cb(err); // if err is not null and not undefined, the orchestration will stop, and 'two' will not run
});</p>

<p>// identifies a dependent task must be complete before this one begins
gulp.task('two', ['one'], function() {
    // task 'one' is done now
});</p>

<p>gulp.task('default', ['one', 'two']);
// alternatively: gulp.task('default', ['two']);
```</p>
</body>
